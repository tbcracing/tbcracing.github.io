    <h1>TBC Racing</h1>
    <p>
      TBC Racing is a highly competitive summer and fall club program which
      trains out of the Thompson Boat Center in Washington, DC. Our summer
      program begins in early June, and runs through early August, with races at
      USRowing Club Nationals and the Canadian Henley. The program is intensive,
      averaging 9 practices per week after the end of school, and is dedicated
      to high performance in both the technical and fitness aspects of the
      sport. This attitude is reflected in our results - in the last 5 years,
      the men's and women's teams have both earned national championships at
      Club Nationals (along with a number of silver and bronze medals). As a
      measure of individual success, our athletes are regularly represented in
      the All-Met awards (6 of the 9 men and 5 of the 9 women in 2015), and
      alumni of the junior program row for the top schools in the country .
      <br />
      Training at TBC takes advatange of the time offered by the summer season.
      Our athletes row and race a variety of hull types, including pairs, fours
      and eights, and we are able to take the time to teach technique on a very
      detailed level. Our coaches are drawn from some of the best in the area,
      with an intense love of the sport, and a long track record of successful
      teams. The program is open to all athletes who have participated in at
      least one season of competitive rowing - Freshmen and Sophomores (high
      school) usually row with our 16 and under squad, while Juniors and Seniors
      row with the 18 and under group.
      <br />
      If you love rowing, want to challenge yourself, develop your skills, and
      compete at the national level, join us this summer on the Potomac!
